= Constraints of each Pass Type =

The way in which different Pass types look is determined by Apple.  The main constraints are the types and location of images that can be used and the number and location of the (text) fields.

The [https://create.passkit.com Pass Designer] will only allow you to input the correct images and text, depending on what Pass Type you choose.

For specific Pass Type examples and layout diagrams please visit the following pages:
