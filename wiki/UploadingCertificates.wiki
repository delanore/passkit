= Generating and Uploading Pass Certificates =

Watch [GeneratePassCertificateVideo this video] or follow the steps below to create a certificate for use with PassKit and upload it to your account.

_*Note:* The certificate that you generate will be exclusively for use with the PassKit service.  If you want to independently produce and sign your own passes, you will need to generate an another certificate, using your own CSR, through the Apple Developer portal._

=== Step 1 ===
Log in to PassKit and generate a CSR containing your account details through the 'Certificates' tab of your 'My Account' page.

=== Step 3 ===

Create a new Pass Type ID.  Your description should be something meaningful that will help you identify the certificate.

Identifiers are conventionally give in reverse domain format to ensure uniqueness. A certificate named _greatstorecard_ for _example.com_ would have an identifier of  _pass.com.example.greatsotrecard_. However, your identifier can be anything, providing the first five characters are pass. and it is unique.
