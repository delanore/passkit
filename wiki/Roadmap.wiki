  * Ability to utilise unique Passk.it certificates for testing and evaluation purposes (for users without an Apple developer account).

What we can tell you will be delivered soon:

We need to keep a little quiet on this, although we can say that we will be able to offer a fully integrated experience for other major mobile platform users than maintains the security and integrity of the framework provided by Apple.  If you are interested in learning more about this either as an investor or as a Pass provider who will be issuing >= 1 million passes a month, you are invited to contact us (note that a Non Disclosure Agreement may be required).
