= Customizing your Pass Colors =

Using the [https://create.passkit.com Pass Designer] it’s easy to customize the color of your Pass. Simply click on the appropriate color swatch and ‘walk around’ the color map until you find the color you want.

If you know the Hex number of the color you want you can simply type that directly into the color box.

There are 3 colors to choose:
  
  * Background Color - is used for the front and back of the pass.  If users provide a background image, any background color is set aside.
  * Data Color - used for field values displayed on the front of the pass
  * Label color - used for field labels displayed on the front of the pass

== Optimizing your Pass colors to blend with your images ==

If you are not sure what colors to choose, but already have an image in mind then we recommend the free tool from Adobe called Kuler.

Here’s a video showing you how to optimize your colors with the help from the Adobe Kuler tool.
