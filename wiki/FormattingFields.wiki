#summary Formatting Fields

= Formatting Fields =

Text fields can be formatted in 3 different ways:

  # Alignment (left, right, center and natural)
  # Date formatters (date and time display styles, like 9/12/2012 or Sep 12, 2012)
  # Number formatters (decimals, percentages and currencies) 

The advantage of specifying a format is that the content will be displayed in a format familiar to the device user.

E.g. the number 'One Thousand' would be displayed as 1,000 to a US user, as 1'000 to a German user and as 1 000 to a French user.

One disadvantage, particularly with date formats is that some language formats are longer than others which may cause unexpected results when the pass is installed on a 'Foreign' device.
