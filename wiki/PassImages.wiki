#summary Uploading your images

= Uploading your images =

As summarized in Pass Constraints section, each Pass Type prescribes particular areas on the front of the pass for each image. Apple has prescribed a certain size of image dependent on the Pass Type.

PassKit automatically scales these images to fit within each allotted space, preserving aspect ratio, but are cropped if the aspect ratio is different than their allotted space.

== Pass Sizes ==

|| Image Type || Position on the Pass || Other notes || Minimum Size (pixels) ||
|| Background Image || Behind the entire front of the pass ||Available on the Event Pass Type. The image is cropped slightly on all sides and blurred || 360 x 440 ||
|| Footer Image || Above the barcode || Available on the Transport Pass Type only || 572 x 30 ||
|| Icon Image || On the lock screen and by apps like Mail when showing an attached Pass || A shine is automatically applied to the icon for you || 116 x 116 ||
|| Logo Image || Displayed in the top left corner of the Pass || The allotted space is 620 x 100 but in most cases it should be narrower.  If you use the full 320 width note the you will not have room for any Logo Text, or Header fields || 620 x 100 ||
|| Strip Image || Displayed behind the Primary Fields || A shine effect is applied by default but you can turn this off in the Pass Designer || Event Tickets: 624 x 168<br />Square Barcode: 624 x 220<br />All other cases: 624 x 246 ||

Please note that your images do not have to be exactly these dimensions, as PassKit will automatically crop and scale them.  However, please check in the [https://create.passkit.com Pass Designer] that the images appear as you want them to.

IMPORTANT: If you upload images that are smaller in size than the dimensions above they will not appear sharp. We strongly recommend you do not use small images.
