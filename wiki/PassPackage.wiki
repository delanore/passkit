= How is a Pass generated =

Passes are created by providing data in a package that contains the Pass.  The package describes the contents of the Pass and allows some control over the visual appearance. 

Technically this Pass package is a bundle of files:
  # A main text file, in a prescribed format, that holds the Pass content and formatting information (e.g. Pass Type, text alignment etc..)
  # Images
  # Alternative text and images suitable for different languages

In addition, each Pass contains a manifest that list the contents of each Pass and a digital signature that authenticates both Pass information and images.

Passes can be updated after they have been distributed by using a push notification; instructing the device that a new version of the pass is available. 

PassKit's simple and intuitive web interface enables you to quickly and easily generate and update these bundles, conforming to Apple's requirements
